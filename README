This attempts to help me understand how Java encodes characters. The
character which is used to identify this is 0xE2, which is a Latin-1
(ISO-8859-1) character. This gets converted to Unicode, and when you
look at data3.txt after running this script, you'll see that the raw
bytes are different. The neat thing is that the characters in the file
are the same, so long as you are looking at them using a system
(e.g. terminal) which is using the right encoding. So, for data2.txt,
you need a Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoded terminal, whereas for
data3.txt, you want a UTF-8 terminal. If you compare the characters
this way, they are the same.
